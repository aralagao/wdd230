  <p>The main colors that will be used on the website will be white and green. I want the website to look clean and fresh. Different shades of green will be used as accents and as background for paragraphs.</p>
  <p>I will be using Lato as primary font, Times New Roman as secondary font, and Futura as complementary font. I will mainly use Lato for paragraphs. I will use Times New Roman for headings and Futura for quotes. </p>
