    <h1>BGC Chamber of Commerce</h1>
  </header>
  <p class="description">The BGC Chamber of Commerce acts as a regional economic catalyst, leadership convener and community champion. We promote business through member services, economic and community development, and public policy that balances economic prosperity"</p>
  <div>
    <h3>Scenarios:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What events will the chamber be holding in the next months?</li>
      <li>Where can I find contact information?</li>
      <li>What are some things to explore in the area?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>The main colors that will be used on the website will be white and green. I want the website to look clean and fresh. Different shades of green will be used as accents and as background for paragraphs.</p>
  <p>I will be using Lato as primary font, Roboto Slab as secondary font, and Bitter as complementary font. I will mainly use Lato for paragraphs. I will use Roboto SLab for headings and Bitter for quotes. </p>
