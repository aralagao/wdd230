            <p>Apple uses White Space and Clean Deisgn to highlight their Ipad products. The different color options for their Ipads are being shown off. It is a great way to highlight and capture the attention of the audience who go on their website.</p>

            <p>Amazon uses allignment on their home page to produce a clean look. Their products on the home page are alligned perfectly. It is a very clean way of showing their products.</p>

            <p>Apple uses the Rule of Thirds to show off their Vision Pro product. The page is divided into three rows and three columns and the name of the product that they are advertising is right the in the middle. It is a good way to highlight the product name because the audience is attrated in the middle of the imagery. </p>
